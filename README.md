# Student Dropout Prediction 

This project focuses on predicting student attrition (dropout) using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to identify students at risk early to help educational institutions improve retention rates.

##  Project Overview
Student dropout is a significant challenge for universities worldwide. This repository contains a data-driven approach to analyze academic, socioeconomic, and demographic factors to predict whether a student will graduate, drop out, or remain enrolled.

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
